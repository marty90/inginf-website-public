Cookies are small text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Further information about what cookies are can be found on wikipedia: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cooki>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</a></p><h2 id=types-of-cookies>Types of cookies</h2><p>The Italian Data Protection Authority broadly divides cookies into different categories depending on their use and on who sends (sets) the cookie.</p><h3 id=technical-cookies>Technical cookies</h3><p>Technical cookies are cookies necessary for website navigation or to provide the services offered by the website. They are not used for ulterior purposes.</p><p>To quote the Italian Data Protection Authority,</p><blockquote><p>Technical cookies are those used exclusively with a view to &ldquo;carrying out the transmission of a communication on an electronic communications network, or insofar as this is strictly necessary to the provider of an information society service that has been explicitly requested by the contracting party or user to provide the said service.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3 id=profiling-cookies>Profiling cookies</h3><p>Profiling cookies are cookies used to track user navigation and create a profile of their habits which can then be used to send advertising messages to the user&rsquo;s device.
Once again quoting the Italian Data Protection Authority,</p><blockquote><p>Profiling cookies are aimed at creating user profiles. They are used to send ads messages in line with the preferences shown by the user during navigation. In the light of the highly invasive nature of these cookies vis-Ã -vis users&rsquo; private sphere, Italian and European legislation requires users to be informed appropriately on their use so as to give their valid consent.</p></blockquote><p>Cookies can also be categorized into first party and third party cookies depending on who sets the cookie.</p><h3 id=first-party-cookies>First party cookies</h3><p>These are set directly by the website that you are visiting and can only be accessed by that site.</p><h3 id=third-party-cookies>Third party cookies</h3><p>Third party cookies are set by a different organisation to the owner of the website you are visiting. For example, the website might use a third party analytics company who will set their own cookie to perform this service. The website you are visiting may also contain content embedded from, for example YouTube or Flickr, and these sites may set their own cookies.</p><h2 id=cookies-used-by-this-website>Cookies used by this website</h2><h3 id=first-party-cookies-1>First party cookies</h3><p>This website uses no cookies.</p><h2 id=how-to-manage-cookies>How to manage cookies</h2><p>You can manage cookies by modifying your web browser preferences (see the following paragraph for more details of how to do this).
