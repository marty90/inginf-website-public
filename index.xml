Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is about the design of controllers and/or morphologies for autonomous robotic (possibly simulated) agents by means of evolutionary computation. ALife and ER are complementary and enable research with an higher level of abstraction on human-robot interaction.</description></item><item><title>Home</title><link>https://www.inginf.units.it/home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.inginf.units.it/home/</guid><description>The Computer Engineering Group The Computer Engineering group at the University of Trieste is composed of six faculty members and a number of PhD students and research assistants..</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Lab</title><link>https://www.inginf.units.it/labs/malelab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.inginf.units.it/labs/malelab/</guid><description>Machine Learning is a set of methods and techniques for constructing software systems automatically by analyzing only examples of the desired behaviour.
You do not write a program. You only provide examples of what you want. The program will be synthesized automatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
