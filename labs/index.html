We work on cybersecurity, information extraction, and automated software engineering, often combining ML with genetic programming, evolutionary optimisation, and programming by example.</p><p>In the Machine Learning Lab, we study how to build trustworthy and effective ML systems through rigorous experimentation on realistic data. Recent publications include browser-based phishing detection with deep learning, secure Wi-Fi and web infrastructures, learning regular expressions and text patterns from examples, and interpretable models for scientific and business data. We aim at involving students from a broad range of disciplines in these research activities.</p></article><article class=person-card><h2 class=person-card__name>Evolutionary Robotics and Artificial Life Lab</h2><img src=/assets/imgs/erallab.png alt="Evolutionary Robotics and Artificial Life Lab"><p>Artificial Life (ALife) studies systems, processes, and evolution of natural life through software or robot-based simulation. Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is about the design of controllers and/or morphologies for autonomous robotic agents by means of evolutionary computation.</p><p>In the ERAL lab, we try to address some big research questions concerning ALife and ER, by means of experimentation and building on our strong background of evolutionary computation. We aim at involving students from a broad range of disciplines in our research activities.</p></article><article class=person-card><h2 class=person-card__name>Cybersecurity Lab</h2><img src=/assets/imgs/cslab.png alt="Cybersecurity Lab"><p>Cybersecurity Lab explores methods for protecting networks, services and users in modern complex systems. We focus on traffic analysis, anonymisation techniques, phishing and URL classification, and the security implications of novel Internet protocols such as HTTP/3.</p><p>In the Cybersecurity Lab, we bring together rigorous experimentation on real-world data and advanced algorithmic techniques to address open challenges in Internet security and privacy. We welcome students from computer science, engineering, mathematics and allied fields to contribute and learn in our research-rich environment.</p></article></div></section></main></body></html>
